## Contribute ##

One of the good things about open source projects is that anyone can code on them. Contributions are greatly welcomed.

If you have something you want to contribute to Dusk (maybe you've got a cool new thing you added to your personal version of Dusk, or a bug you fixed that was bothering you, or a bug you added that you think other people would love to be bothered with), great! Start by reading the style guide in this same folder and making sure your code fits into the guidelines in it. I'm an extreme perfectionist, which means Dusk has to *look* good as well as work well. Yep, even though few people actually read the code. Once you're ready, submit a pull request and I'll look over it as soon as I can.

If you're not sure about being a coder on Dusk, that's great, too - you can add to the wiki. Note that the wiki is not a place for formal documentation (that's coming soon, hopefully). If you want to write a nice "getting started" guide that goes in a little deeper than the quickstart, or, if you're a veteran Dusk user, a "camera system in depth" guide or something else like that, please do so! Any contributions are helpful.

If you don't know what you want to contribute to Dusk, that's great, too. Check through the GitHub issues and see if there's anything you can fix. Fix away, and return to the paragraph above this one.

Thanks!
